# LTFW-or-LinuxTerminalForWindows
This is my first project on C++ - LTFW or LinuxTerminalForWindows


I decided to create some kind of alternative to WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).Sometimes it's just inconvenient to use WSL, but I want to try to offer an alternative. 


mini .exe is an open source program (even with a ready-made solution for Visual Studio 2022 in a .sln file)

!!!⚠This is my first experience in C++ programming, so if there are any major mistakes... Don't take it personally⚠!!!
